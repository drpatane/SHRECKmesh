# Hot Single Mortals in Your Area...

...that want you dead

The Camarilla completely deny that the Inquisition is in Houston. Our beneficent Principal of the Faith will stake you for heresy for even suggesting the fact. If you want my opinion, there's only one way that gaggle of christo-fascist hunters got access to white phosphorus. Had to be Second Inquisition. I'm guessing some handler at FIRSTLIGHT decided to test out a farm team and probe our defenses. Defenses that would have been stronger if we weren't still communicating like we live in the 12th century but I'll save that rant for another post.

Anyway, congrats. You have the joy of un-living under the greatest security and surveillance apparatus in history. Since you're here, you're obviously interested in all the fun ways you can meet your final death by mortal hands. So here's what I, your humble webmaster, knows. 

### The Catholics

Of course the original Bible thumpers are here, they've been hunting us for millennia. We've had reports of priests in the Society of St. Leopold poking around, but the church is so byzantine who knows what other groups of collared freaks are snooping around. 

### The Feds

You all already know about FIRSTLIGHT, the NSA's favorite little conspiracy. The Cammies use these guys as bedtime stories to scare Childer after they infiltrated the OG Shrecknet (and oh how they never let us Nosferatu forget it). If you're stupid online, these fucks will black bag you. So don't fucking fedpost.

But wait there's more! Hoover's boys over at the FBI have their "Special Affairs" group that's been tracking Kindred since the '20s. Apparently they have some pretty cool toys they *sometimes* like to share. 

Then you've got all the other TLAs that haven't been read in, but love tracking Americans just the same. ICE, CIA, CDC, etc. can all spot your shit and get you dusted if you're not careful. 

### The Normies

Sometimes a mortal sees something they shouldn't, they get a "message from god," or simply read too much Supernatural fanfic and decide to go hunting. Some are competent, most aren't. They can all still fuck you up if you're not on your toes.
