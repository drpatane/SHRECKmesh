# Hot Single Mortals in Your Area...

...that want you dead

If you want my opinion, there's only one way that bunch of christo-fascist hunters got access to white phosphorus. Had to be Second Inquisition. I'm guessing some handler at FIRSTLIGHT decided to test out a farm team and probe our defenses. Defenses that would have been stronger if we weren't still communicating like we live in the 12th century but that rant is for another post.

Anyway, congrats. You have the joy of un-living under the greatest security and surveillance apparatus in history...
