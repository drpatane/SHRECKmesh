# Welcome

*created by DraC00La, 10/22/2025*
*edited by DraC00La, 1/23/2026*

If you're reading this, congratulations. You "hacked the planet" as the kine say these days. And did so without getting dusted by the sheriff or getting your connection spiked by some SI wetwork team.

What is this place? Why, it's SchreckNet 2.0! Now using the most secure and decentralized mesh network ever devised, here to deliver the critical information tonight's kindred need to survive! Our brave editors work tirelessly to rebuild the knowledge lost after the infiltration by the SI and Camarilla blood hunt. The Net shall be free once more!

## Notable Events

Houston's Kindred are a dramatic bunch, even more so after the primogen left. We cover that whole shitshow in [[ShreckMesh/Houston by Night/Houston for Childer(en)\|Houston for Childer(en)]]. 
## Important Kindred

The Camarilla claims the whole city. The Anarchs claim the whole city. Both are liars. See [[ShreckMesh/Houston by Night/The Court of Houston\|The Court of Houston]] for the Camarilla licks who think they run the place. [[ShreckMesh/Houston by Night/Anarch-y in Houston\|Anarch-y in Houston]] does the same thing for the Anarchs who think they're revolutionaries. Same parasites, different night. 
## The Inquisition

ICE in the streets, mysterious men in black, mortals dusting elders, something is going on in Houston. [[ShreckMesh/Houston by Night/Hot Single Mortals in Your Area\|Hot Single Mortals in Your Area]] keeps track so you can die another day.

Sometimes when a "friend" calls in a favor, you consider taking up sunbathing instead. I don't know who this "V" is. I don't know why it's so necessary that their "poetry" takes up precious space on the mesh. But a deal's a deal. *This makes us even.*
