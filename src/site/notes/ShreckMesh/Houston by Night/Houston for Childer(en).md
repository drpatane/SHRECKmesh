# Houston for Childer(en)

*last edited by DraC00La, 10/22/2025*

And you thought mortal politics was a mess in this city... 

#### Notable Events
___
**October 31, 2019**: The entire Court and (most) of the elders sitting on the Primogen council simply fucked off. The few who bothered to communicate to the rest of the city's kindred spoke of the "Beckoning."

**November 1, 2019**: The remains of the Tremere Primogen are found inside his haven. Hidden in a secret complex underneath Rice University's Library, mortal authorities are alerted after smoke alarms go off in the main stacks. Camarilla agents inside law enforcement report that expended white phosphorus munitions were discovered at the scene. While mortal officials blame a local extremist Christian cult, conspiracies abound after the members are found dead in an apparent post-attack suicide.

**November 5, 2019**: Houston's former Seneschal, [[3 Characters/3.2 NPCs/Castor Augustus\|Castor Augustus]], appoints himself Prince. Although highly unusual, the recent abdications from the Court leave little in the way of opposition. It helps that his close ally, [[3 Characters/3.2 NPCs/Violet Rosenberg\|Violet Rosenberg]] was already sheriff.
