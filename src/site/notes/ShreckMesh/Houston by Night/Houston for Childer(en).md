November 1, 2019: The remains of the Tremere Primogen are found inside his inner sanctum. Hidden in a secret library complex underneath Rice University's Library, it is found after smoke alarms go off in the main stack.

November 5, 2019: Houston's former Seneschal, [[3 Characters/3.2 NPCs/Castor Augustus\|Castor Augustus]], appoints himself Prince. Although highly unusual, the recent abdications from the Court leave little in the way of opposition.
