# Houston for Childer(en)

*last edited by DraC00La, 10/22/2025*

And you thought mortal politics was a mess in this city... 


#### Notable Events
___
**October 31, 2019**: The entire Court and (most) of the elders sitting on the Primogen council simply "fuck off." The few who bothered to communicate to the rest of the city's kindred spoke of the "Beckoning." 

**November 1, 2019**: The Primogen of Clan Tremere, one of the few elders to resist the Beckoning, goes missing. Conspiracies abound. 

**January 1, 2020**: Houston's former Seneschal, Castor Augustus, appoints himself Prince. Although highly unusual, the recent abdications from the Court leave little in the way of opposition. It helps that his close ally, Violet Rosenberg is already sheriff.

**March 21, 2020:** Someone living, dead, or furry, dusts Clan Brujah's Baron, Maximilian. His disintegrating corpse lands in the middle of a downtown street, packed with drunken kine enjoying the nightlife. The Masquerade is fucked. Accusations fly, conspiracies abound, chaos reigns, etc. The **Years of Ash** begin. 

**July 16, 2020**: The first ShreckMesh node goes live! We had COVID hobbies too, you know. 

**May 1, 2021:** Whining about "exploitation" by the Camarilla and Anarchs alike, the duskborn (derogatory) "proclaim" the Emancipated Domain of Montrose. Declared a free domain for all clanless and protected by "community defense coteries," nothing changes because it turns out you still have to pay rent. 

**October 22, 2022:** Julian Lamont, favorite childer of the Beckoned Toreador primogen, is assassinated by mortal hunters. His is the highest profile final death during the Years of Ash. Conspiracies abound.

**July 1, 2022:** Several well-known Tremere see their final sunrise. Staked and left to burn out in the Sam Houston National Forest. The Camarilla blame the Lupines. Sure thing.

**February 14, 2023:** Several licks from Clan Malkavian are executed by the Sheriff for going viral on TikTok. Apparently "dark academia" is a Masquerade violation. 

**June 13, 2023:** The sects finally realize that final deathing each other all over the city is bad for business and good for the Second Inquisition. The Camarilla and Anarchs agree to a tenuous peace. Mixed-sect coterie assignments begin as a "token of good faith" but only fools believe that line. The Years of Ash end.

**November 1, 2025**: The remains of the Tremere Primogen are found inside his haven, a secret complex underneath Rice University's Library. Mortal authorities are alerted after smoke alarms go off in the main stacks. Camarilla agents inside law enforcement report that expended white phosphorus munitions were discovered at the scene. While mortal officials blame a local extremist Christian cult, conspiracies abound after the members are found dead in an apparent post-attack suicide.
