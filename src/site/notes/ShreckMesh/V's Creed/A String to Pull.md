# A String to Pull

The shadow called us to her lair
High up in her lofty tower
Orders from above to find
A special thing
A how 
A why 

A string to pull, but not much more
For hunters lurked
And if we were found 
Our doom was certain
From within and without

We rode to where the music pulsed
Wading into the shoals 
Of the water veined ones
Lights and colors swirled around us 
As if we floated in the glittering night sky

The poet communed with her maker
The haunted one chatted with the dead
The rider sulked and waited
While the shadow found the end 
Of a string
That she pulled 
And found a hint
To go to a place known for its pleasures 
In poultices and potions 
Tonics and elixers
Miraculous concoctions that made 
The impossible possible

The mad one spotted a pair of hunters
One with a glass eye
Predators who were looking 
For people like us
People who are different
People who just want to die in this city 

We tried to escape them 
The rider confused their sight
But the shadow was found
By the glassy eye
She compelled one 
To pin the eyed one down 
While the poet 
Used her charms to 
Receive the eye 
Broken in two by an eager hand

To the apothecary we went
A lair of the water veined
The mad one was convincing
As a partaker of the turgid stuff
Pineapple cum
A rarified substance that they no longer had
The rider boldly marched her way to the door
Braving weapons and ruin 
To speak to their leader

Their leader denied that they wasted blood
The blamed the work of warlocks and witches
Practitioners of a craft beyond their skill
In fact, one of their number was missing from their nearby home 

The shadow offered their leader a boon

The five followed the string 
Pulling it to see where it led
Further and further
Into the darkness
