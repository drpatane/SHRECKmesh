# The Shape of a Home

*observed on 12/4/2025*

In between new townhomes gleaming
An overgrown sketch of a dream
The hands of time drew lines loosely
Over creaking, broken beams

The shape of a house 
Or, at least it was
Cohabited by two 

A wife whose time grew shorter as
The resident of that dream
On the night she would finally tell him
Of her imminent plans to leave

A glass she drank 
Of wine she did not favor 
Became the last thing 
she remembered living 
An empty cup that killed her

She woke in fits and starts
Waking through the years
Squatters and vagrants, 
rats and vermin 
Took over the walls 
and the floor at her feet 

She would hear he husband yelling 
from the kitchen down the hall. 
The pots and plates he threw 
Made pock marks on the wall 

One night The Five came by to visit 
Their mission had been clear:
To find the missing water veined
And find out who sold their gear

The Mad One could sense 
That something bad had happened here
The Mistress of the Dead could see 
a bubble faintly clear 
Surrounding the house with shame 
and cloaking it in the type of sadness 
that makes people turn away 
to rather put their eyes on something else
than confront what could be in there. 

The Road Warrior picked up an empty bag
that once had filled with life 

The Mad One found a room 
with empty glasses on a table

The spector's scream was piercing 
s ending the Shadow and the Rider 
from the room. 

The Mistress spoke with the spector 
who told the story of her final drink
As her husband yelled from the kitchen
and banged something against the wall 

The Rider returned to explore 
and a pot cracked against her head. 
She threw it back with force 
as the five joined alongside her

The Shadow saw the outline of a man
running toward the warrior. 
He asked if we had seen the woman his wife was going to run away with
The Rider mimicked the voice of the wife coming from another room 
Then gave the mistress a chance to strike and slurp up some essence

A plate was thrown at the Poet, 
But the Rider intervened 
Catching the thing in mid flight
The Poet didn't have much in words to say
But her "eyes were on the prize."

The Rider found this spector's anchor: a noose 
and gave it to the Mistress
Who set about to light it
But the man was not a passive witness 

He swiped at the Mistress,
But the Poet intervened
She expressed sympathy 
For a life ended alone
He left being understood and at peace 

The Mistress of the dead moved on to the wife
Who said it had felt quieter
She spoke of others living in the house and in the adjoining room

The Rider went in that room first
While the Mistress helped the woman pass on to find her lover 

We found the missing one
Whose blood ran like water
Similarly spectored
Another regretful dead
Who wanted the leader of their group 
To know that he was there. 

The Rider pocketed a photograph
The spector's worldly anchor 
While the five went their separate ways 
For the night was nearly over
