# Lamb's Blood

*observed on 11/6/2025*

Oh where? Oh where did all the blood go?
This empty lamb. This empty shepherd. 
Pure. Unblemished. Whole. 
Laid on the table of the haunted mistress's home. 

We five followed this bloodless trail. 
Up the hill to the churchyard
We saw one pig. Two pig. Minding the door. 
One pig. Big pig. Bled a confession. 
A road nun in leathers pulled it out of him
As a wide eyed poet watched in awe. 

The shadow found the blood on and above the altar. 
The figure of the Christ as unblemished as the sacrifice. 
The mad one's mind spoke of blood like water 
And sensed another empty vessel, small and glassy. 

The bloodless shepherd was no lamb and no mere man: 
A hunter of hunters. 
Hung like a floating, stringless marionette above the altar. 
Emptied in poetic slaughter. 

Leaving a mess for others to clean. 
Others like us. 
Kith and kin. 
These wasters of blood. 
These water veined ones. 
We will wade into their shoals until we find the blood stained one.
