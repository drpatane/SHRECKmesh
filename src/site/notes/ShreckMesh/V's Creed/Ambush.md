# Ambush

*observed on 1/15/2026*

The Mortician shared smoke with her elder 
He wanted to know what we've seen
She called us and we gathered
But our words, he never heard

Instead, to his and our surprise, 
The sheriff wandered in
The Shadow spoke to her 
Of a connection to a old friend
A witch whose name fell from the lips 
Of the water veined specter we had found:

Genevieve was the name. 
A name that endangered us all. 
New evidence that gave us one night 
To investigate the burned primogen's home.

We were sent to the University library 
And as we ventured toward the stairs
The Seer bumped into 
A strangely calm mortal 
A stack of books in his hands

The Rider lifted him off his feet
The Poet spoke to him sweetly
He spoke of cleansing the world of
A pestilence of blank bodies

The Rider and the Shadow 
Filled his mind with a command:
Walk far, far away to a wooded land

The Five went further down 
An elevator took them
To a secluded chamber which stunk of garlic

Empty racks for computing machines
A lab with papyrus bits with runes 
And a burned out bedroom 
With a slagged iron bed 
With nothing the Mortician could find 
A primogen's spirit to cling to
Though, a grenade canister showed us 
How this conflagration had quickly begun

Up the elevator went the five 
And, when those doors had opened
Four mortals had trained their weapons 
On the Five who outnumbered them.
