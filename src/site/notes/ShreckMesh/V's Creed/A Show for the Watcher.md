# A Show for the Watcher

*observed on 1/29/2026*

five versus Five
Five mortals 
Yelling commands 
Guns in hand
Freeze
Hands on your head
Five eternal 
A moment of illusion from the Rider 
The Shadow ends a rush forward 
With a punch sending one backward
And falling to the floor
The Mortician tries 
To hide behind a bookshelf
A gun turns to her
The voice of the Poet 
Calls out to the gunman
Embrace me
The man moves compelled
Another begins pulling out a wooden stake 
The Rider approaches menacingly 
But the mortal does not relent and shoots 
The Seer cloaks herself in shadow
A weapon fires a flash of fire
The Seer and Poet are engulfed
They begin to burn
Another shot at the Rider
The Seer puts out her fire
But the Poet does not
The Poet drinks from the mortal
Coming to embrace her
As she keeps burning
The Shadow punches a mortal
Into a wall
The Rider appears horrifying to another
While she takes off his helmet 
And takes off his ears 
The Seer steps on the gun 
Of the one on the floor 
And kicks him in the head
The Mortician sees a premonition
The Poet slips in a pool of blood
Below her tip toed feet 
And falls backwards into the open elevator
Her head crushed by the closing doors 
Watch your step
The Mortician says 
As she pushes a bookshelf 
Onto the mortal on the floor. 
The Shadow steps out of the way
But loses control and feeds
A bloody mess 
The Seer and the Mortician 
Listen for sounds outside
But do not hear any
The Seer thinks it strange 
The Shadow finishes feeding 
And crushes her prey's head
With her heel 
The Seer feeds on another mortal 
Biting bits of flesh from its neck
The Poet, still burning
Finishes
As she lays down her prey with a caress 
She extinguishes
Her flame 
The Rider feeds on the remaining mortal
The five are dead 
The Five remain

The Shadow's servant is summoned
The Seer examines the bodies 
Their armor is ill fitting
The Shadow recalls their lack of discipline

The Mortician removes one of the faces
For use in a ritual

The Shadow's servant mentions a Watcher
The Shadow and Poet follow
And see a man in a black suit
Outside of a black ride
He applauds
He leaves

The Five do not know 
How to find this Watcher
The Rider rides off
The Seer uses the sight 
She has a vision of papers 
Beautiful written script 
In a display case like many others
Papers we must retrieve

The Shadow proposes a party
Rent out the museum 
Have the Poet host
It's the Poet's dream come true

The Five go out into the night
Their path decided 
But their feet must walk it
