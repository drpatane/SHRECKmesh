#Olivia 


There were five
Fingers to a hand
A fist to clench
A caress
A band

The road warrior
Canines of an animal
My kind of animal

The mad one
Visions of everything
A digital deluge of brain rot

The haunted mistress
Caretaker of the dead
Seer of the unseen

The shadow
Bringer of death
Darkness follows her

And me
The poet
So many words
Falling from my lips
Lips that speak
Lips that kiss
